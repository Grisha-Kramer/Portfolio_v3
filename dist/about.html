            I was recently certified by the University of Richmond's Full Stack Coding Boot Camp.  I have extensive experience working in startups, with a focus on digital advertising and analytics.

            Most of my professional experience came at Relay Foods, a VC startup where I was initially hired as a Brand Ambassador.  After three years and two promotions I was leading a team of five and my responsibilities included maintaining a budget for traditional advertising in four cities, fostering community partnerships as well as owning analytics.

          <p>
            At Seasonal Roots I was hired to handle analytics, and ended up owning digital advertising on Google Ads and Facebook.

          <p>
            I'm usually engaged in some culinary experiment that involves making something yourself (Cheese, sourdough, mousse etc), or playing guitar, synths, piano, drums, cello, accordion, beatbox or vocals (listed in order of descending competence).  If I'm not doing that then I'm probably biking.
